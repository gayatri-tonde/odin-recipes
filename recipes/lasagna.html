        <h2>Description</h2>
        Lasagna also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven (al forno). The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 (14.5-oz.) cans whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp. dried parsley, divided</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. dried basil</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>2 (6-oz.) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 c. low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
    <li>1 (1o-oz.) package lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2> 
   <ol>  
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until al dente (not overly cooked). Drain.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.
        </li>
        <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to 2 days, or bake immediately: 350°F oven until the top is hot and bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
